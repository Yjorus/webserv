				<h2>How To Protect Your Personal Information & Privacy Online</h2>
				<h3>How Secure is Your Private Information Online?</h3>
				<p>By all accounts, 2023 has been the worst year ever for online privacy. In just the first six months of the year, 1,393 data breaches leaked private and personal data from over 156 million Americans.
					
					In one of the worst examples, the MOVEit data transfer breach gave hackers access to private healthcare data from millions of patients in Missouri, Oregon, and more.</p>
					<h3>While having your private healthcare information made public would be a nightmare for most people, less extreme data leaks and compromises happen on a daily basis.</h3>
					<p>Keeping your personal and private information safe is a critical part of online safety.
						
						The more personal details scammers and fraudsters have about you, the easier it is for them to hack your accounts, steal your identity, and scam you.  
						
						While it’s getting harder to live a “private life” online, it’s not impossible. With a few steps and additional security measures, you can learn how to protect your privacy, fend off identity thieves and hackers, and take back control of your personal data.</p>
